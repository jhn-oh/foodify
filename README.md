# Foodify, your PlatePal
Foodify, our entry for the "RC Creativity Platform 2023" competition hosted by Yonsei University and sponsored by Nexon, has become a sensation since its release on September 13th, 2023. With a focus on personalized food recommendations, our platform has garnered a user base of 100 within the first three days and has now been used by over 350 people, generating over 1,000 recommendations.

Operating under the domain 'foodify.kr' until September 2024, Foodify is your go-to guide for discovering the best culinary experiences in and around Yonsei University International Campus. The platform's success has been fueled by our team's manual collection of a comprehensive database, covering all the culinary delights in Campus town and Triple Street.

Please note that for security reasons, we have deleted the whole commit histories and the database file containing food data. Consequently, the code on our GitHub repository is not functional and should be used solely for reference purposes.
